## Features of the Editor

1. Writing Code
  - The editor is preloaded with a basic example (const App = () => <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;).
  - You can modify the code in the editor as you like. This React code will be transpiled and rendered in real-time in the preview section.

2. Live Preview
  - As you write code, the preview will automatically update to show the output of your React code.
  - The editor uses Babel to transpile your JavaScript/JSX into browser-readable JavaScript.
    
3. Adding Packages
  - You can add external JavaScript libraries using the Package Manager input.
  - Type the name of the package (e.g., lodash, axios) and click Add Package.
  - The package will be dynamically imported and available for use in your code.
    
4. Running Code
  - Once youâ€™re happy with the code, click the Run button to execute the code and see the results in the preview.
